description = """
This script creates a sequence of easystack files that may be used to replicate the software installed
 in a reference software subdirectory.

The script
 - Determines all software that was installed in the reference prefix
 - Sorts it in order of installation. For software that was later rebuilt, the original installation time is used.
 - In the installation order, easyconfig names are added to easystack files
 - A new easystack file is started when either the EasyBuild version to be used changes, or when the maximum build
 time is exceeded (build times of the software in the reference software subdir are used to estimate this)

By sticking to the original order in which software was installed, using the robot option should not be needed. Since nothing
is installed by the robot, one is able to guarantee that the same easyconfigs and easyblocks are used that were
used during original installation time.

If an argument is provided for --eb-override-version, installations of EasyBuild itself are performed before
anything else, with the EasyBuild version provided as argument.

Example:

python3 eessi_software_reproduce_stack.py --reference-software-subdir=x86_64/amd/zen2 --eessi-version 2025.06
will create easystacks that allow you to replicate the software installed in
/cvmfs/software.eessi.io/versions/2025.06/<eessi-version>/software/linux/<reference-software-subdir>,
provided the logs of these installations were backed up to
/cvmfs/software.eessi.io/versions/2025.06/<eessi-version>/software/linux/<reference-software-subdir>/reprod
(which was standard practice starting with EESSI version 2025.06).

Known limitations: if additional dependencies were added in rebuilds, building them at the original (first)
build time will case a failure. See e.g. https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer/issues/1430
